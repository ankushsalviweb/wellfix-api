# WellFix - Plan: Phase 5 - Testing, Deployment Prep & Documentation Review

**Phase Goal:** Conduct comprehensive integration testing, perform final code/documentation reviews, prepare deployment artifacts (e.g., Dockerfile), and ensure the application meets non-functional requirements.

**Depends On:** Phase 4 Completion

**Related Documentation:**
*   All `/docs` documents (review)
*   All `/rules` documents (final check)
*   `docs/non-functional-requirements.mdc` (focus)

---

## Tasks Breakdown (Check -> Code -> Test -> Iterate)

**1. Comprehensive Integration Testing**
    *   [ ] **Check:** Review end-to-end user flows (Customer scheduling, Engineer workflow, Admin management).
    *   [ ] **Test:** Write and execute integration tests covering complex scenarios involving multiple API calls and state changes (e.g., full lifecycle of an on-site job, full lifecycle of a lab job including quote).
    *   [ ] **Test:** Perform exploratory testing focusing on edge cases, error conditions, and security vulnerabilities (e.g., authorization checks between roles).
    *   [ ] **Code:** Fix any bugs identified during integration testing.
    *   [ ] **Iterate:** Refine tests and code based on findings.

**2. Non-Functional Requirements Testing & Validation**
    *   [ ] **Check:** Review `docs/non-functional-requirements.mdc`.
    *   [ ] **Test (Performance):** Conduct basic load testing on key API endpoints (e.g., login, list jobs, update status) to ensure response times meet targets under simulated load (using tools like `locust` or `k6`).
    *   [ ] **Test (Security):** Perform final security checks: review dependencies for known vulnerabilities, check for common web vulnerabilities (manual checks or using basic scanning tools), verify RBAC enforcement.
    *   [ ] **Test (Reliability):** Review logging output for clarity and completeness. Review error handling for consistency.
    *   [ ] **Test (Usability/Responsiveness):** Requires frontend integration, but review API design for factors impacting frontend usability.
    *   [ ] **Code:** Address any performance bottlenecks, security issues, or reliability concerns identified.
    *   [ ] **Iterate:** Optimize code, improve logging/error handling as needed.

**3. Code Quality & Rule Adherence Review**
    *   [ ] **Check:** Ensure all code adheres to style guides (`rules/python-code-style-consistency-rule.mdc`) using linters/formatters (e.g., Black, Flake8).
    *   [ ] **Check:** Review code for modularity (`rules/python-modular-design-rule.mdc`) and clarity (`rules/python-ai-friendly-coding-practices-rule.mdc`).
    *   [ ] **Check:** Verify docstrings and comments are present and accurate (`rules/python-documentation-rule.mdc`).
    *   [ ] **Check:** Ensure configuration (`rules/python-configuration-management-rule.mdc`) and dependencies (`rules/python-dependency-management-rule.mdc`) are managed correctly.
    *   [ ] **Code:** Refactor code to address any identified quality issues or rule violations.
    *   [ ] **Iterate:** Conduct final peer reviews of critical sections.

**4. Documentation Finalization**
    *   [ ] **Check:** Review all documents in `/docs` for accuracy, consistency, and completeness based on the final implementation.
    *   [ ] **Code (Docs):** Update `docs/api-design.md` with any minor changes made during implementation.
    *   [ ] **Code (Docs):** Update `README.md` (create if not exists) with project overview, setup instructions (local development), and basic usage.
    *   [ ] **Code (Docs):** Ensure code documentation (docstrings) is complete and renders correctly (if using tools like Sphinx).
    *   [ ] **Iterate:** Final proofread and review of all documentation.

**5. Deployment Preparation**
    *   [ ] **Check:** Review deployment strategy discussed in `docs/architecture-overview.md` (Containerization).
    *   [ ] **Code:** Create `Dockerfile` for building the backend application image.
    *   [ ] **Code:** Create `docker-compose.yml` (optional) for easy local setup including the database (PostgreSQL) and backend service.
    *   [ ] **Code:** Prepare necessary configuration files or environment variable templates for deployment (e.g., `.env.example`).
    *   [ ] **Code:** Write deployment scripts (optional, e.g., shell scripts for common deployment tasks).
    *   [ ] **Test:** Build the Docker image locally. Run the application using Docker Compose.
    *   [ ] **Iterate:** Refine Dockerfile, compose file, and deployment scripts.

**6. Final Test Suite Run & Verification**
    *   [ ] **Test:** Execute the complete test suite (unit and integration tests) one final time to ensure all tests pass.
    *   [ ] **Test:** Manually verify core functionalities one last time in a staging/local environment.

**Phase 5 Definition of Done:**
*   Comprehensive integration tests are written and passing.
*   Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability) have been tested and validated to meet initial targets.
*   Codebase passes all linter/formatter checks and adheres strictly to defined rules.
*   All project documentation (`/docs`, README, docstrings) is complete, accurate, and reviewed.
*   Deployment artifacts (Dockerfile, `.env.example`) are created and tested locally.
*   The final application build is stable and ready for initial deployment/handover.
