# WellFix - Development Roadmap & Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level development plan for the WellFix application. It serves as a roadmap for the development team, breaking down the project into manageable phases. The plan is based on the detailed requirements and design specified in the `/docs` directory:

*   `docs/prd.md`
*   `docs/functional-requirements.md`
*   `docs/non-functional-requirements.mdc`
*   `docs/architecture-overview.md`
*   `docs/data-models.md`
*   `docs/api-design.md`

Detailed tasks for each phase are specified in separate `Plan/XX-phase-*.md` documents.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Iterative Development:** Build the application in phases, focusing on delivering functional increments.
*   **Rule Adherence:** Strictly follow the coding standards and practices defined in the `/rules` directory (e.g., modularity, documentation, error handling, style).
*   **Test-Driven Approach:** Write tests (Unit, Integration) alongside or before implementation code to ensure correctness and facilitate refactoring.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain code documentation (docstrings) and update design documents as needed.
*   **Code Reviews:** Implement peer code reviews for key features to maintain quality and share knowledge.

## 3. Technology Stack Recap

*   **Backend:** Python (3.10+), FastAPI (preferred, or Django), PostgreSQL (14+)
*   **Database Interaction:** SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations (if FastAPI), or Django ORM.
*   **API:** RESTful API as defined in `docs/api-design.md`.
*   **Frontend:** Responsive Web Application (HTML/CSS/JS, framework TBD) consuming the REST API.
*   **Dependencies:** Managed via `pip`/`requirements.txt` or `Poetry` (`rules/python-dependency-management-rule.mdc`).
*   **Configuration:** Environment variables / `.env` files (`rules/python-configuration-management-rule.mdc`).

## 4. Phased Approach

The development is planned in the following logical phases:

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication**
    *   Goal: Establish the project structure, database connection, core data models, and implement robust authentication and basic user management features.
    *   Details: See `Plan/01-phase-foundation.md`
*   **Phase 2: Core Job Workflow (Customer/Admin)**
    *   Goal: Implement the ability for customers to create repair jobs and for admins/customers to view job details and lists. Implement basic admin assignment.
    *   Details: See `Plan/02-phase-core-workflow.md`
*   **Phase 3: Engineer Workflow & Status Updates**
    *   Goal: Implement engineer-specific views, detailed status update logic (including validation), note logging, and the lab escalation process.
    *   Details: See `Plan/03-phase-engineer-workflow.md`
*   **Phase 4: Admin Tools, Ratings & Polish**
    *   Goal: Implement remaining admin functionalities (serviceable areas, pricing), customer ratings, reporting endpoints, and refine existing workflows based on initial testing.
    *   Details: See `Plan/04-phase-admin-polish.md`
*   **Phase 5: Testing, Deployment Prep & Documentation Review**
    *   Goal: Comprehensive integration testing, finalize documentation, prepare deployment configurations (Dockerfiles, etc.).
    *   Details: See `Plan/05-phase-testing-deployment.md`

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

These aspects should be addressed continuously throughout all phases:

*   **Logging:** Implement consistent logging as per `rules/python-error-handling-and-logging-rule.mdc`.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and user-friendly error responses as per `rules/python-error-handling-and-logging-rule.mdc`.
*   **Security:** Apply security best practices (input validation, authorization checks) consistently.
*   **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for all implemented logic and endpoints.
*   **Documentation:** Keep code comments and docstrings up-to-date.

## 6. Task Tracking

Use a standard issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira) to manage individual tasks detailed in the phase plan documents.
